From the first moment a buyer pulls into your neighborhood, they’re already judging your home. In order to make a great first impression when selling your property, you need to:

**1\. Create a strong curb appeal.** If your driveway or your home’s siding is in need of a good power wash, go ahead and clean it up. Make sure the trees are pruned and you’ve got some fresh flowers planted.&nbsp;

**2\. Have a clean entryway.** If needed, buy a new front doormat. It also can’t hurt to add a fresh coat of paint to your door, and to service the doorbell if it needs it.&nbsp;

**3\. Eliminate any odors.** This includes smells caused by pets, smoke, and other overpowering scents. There’s nothing worse than opening the door to a home and getting slapped in the face with a strong smell of smoke or pets. Additionally, be careful with chemicals; go easy on the potpourri and carpet deodorizers, because those could ultimately make the buyer think you’re hiding something.

**4\. Deep clean the house.** If a buyer walks through your home and notices there are dust bunnies and stains everywhere, they’ll start questioning how well you maintain your home.

**5\. Declutter.** If you have a bunch of stuff laying around taking up floor space, that won’t help you sell the home—get rid of it. If your closets and pantries are packed to the point where they look like a warzone, sort through your possessions and make those spaces clean, functional, and accessible to your buyers.

**6\. Paint.** I don’t mean you have to repaint the entire exterior of the home, although there are studies that suggest you can make 1.5 to 2x the amount you spent on painting back when you sell your home. Mainly, I just mean you should just touch-up the areas where fingerprints, chips, and dings are visible. Giving your home a fresh coat where needed can go a long way in helping your home sell for top dollar.
