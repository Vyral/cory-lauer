We wanted to take a few moments to go over a few common inspection items that come up during a home inspection and can be taken care of very easily and at little cost to you. **Fixing these things will also make the buyer more comfortable about going through with the purchase.**

**1. Window-balancing rods.** It’s very easy to spot a broken one because you’ll be able to see the metal casing within the window frame. They run about $26 at Builder’s Glass and only take about 10 minutes to replace.

**2. Slow or clogged drains, as well as any small leaks.**

**3. Clogged aerators.**

**4. Loose or inoperative door handles or locks.**

**5.  Burnt-out lightbulbs.**

If you take care of all these little things, it’ll be less you have to worry about when it’s inspection time, and it keeps questions about your home’s condition out of the buyer’s mind. If you have any more questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
