Premier Land Title has been a great ally of ours over the years. We recently visited their office and met with Conrad Jakubowski, who spoke to us about the importance of selecting a great title company and having solid title insurance.

When you purchase a home, you receive a deed, which gives you title ownership of real property. Title insurance ensures that you’re able to continue to own that property and that it’s free from any liens and encumbrances.&nbsp;

**The cost of title insurance is about one-half of one percent of the home’s purchase price.** When you pay the premium once, however, it’s good for as long you or one of your heirs owns the property. If a claim comes in down the line, the title insurance pays for all the legal fees involved. It’s something that each and every homeowner should have, which is why any mortgage broker is going to require you to have this type of insurance to qualify.
