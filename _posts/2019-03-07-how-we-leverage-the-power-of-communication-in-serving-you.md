Buying or selling a home can be one of the more stressful times in a person’s life. Here at the Cory Lauer Group, we make it our mission to ease some the experience of pursuing your real estate goals by offering effective communication and excellent customer service.

**We are here to alleviate all pain points you might encounter throughout a transaction.** As soon as we receive a fully rounded contract, we contact a title company and/or lender to get your finances in order for the rest of the deal. We ensure that all parties are working on the same timeline and are taking key actions to enable your success. 

If the home you’re buying is within an HOA (homeowners association), the next step we tackle is submitting your HOA application. This is very important, as such applications can take between 20 to 30 days to process.

We will then make sure that the inspection and feasibility studies are handled, and, after that, that the loan approval process goes smoothly. If it’s a cash deal, however, this is obviously not something we would need to worry about. 

**As we approach the end of the deal, our team will do everything necessary to coordinate closing.** We’ll ensure that you take possession of all necessary keys and manuals associated with the purchase, guide you through transferring utilities, and attend the final walk-through with you to confirm that everything is in the agreed-upon condition. 

Finally, when the day of closing comes, we’ll help you wrap up the deal so that you can move into your new home. And, at our office, we celebrate every closed deal by ringing the bell featured in today’s video. Every deal is special to us, as is every client.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
