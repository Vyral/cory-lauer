In the past 10 to 12 years, we’ve been getting more and more involved in the sale of vacant land. These primarily include large acreage parcels, waterfront properties, and typical half-acre lots in Southwest Florida. In these sales, we often deal with wetlands, and today we’d like to detail the difference between wetland and upland property.
