Every time you move into a new property, there are six critical steps you must take to ensure a safe, seamless, and stress-free transition:

**1\. Change the locks.** Call a locksmith and make sure the locks are changed at every entry point of your home.&nbsp;

**2\. Deep clean your home.** You likely expect your new home to be spotless when you move in, so be sure to grant the buyers of your old home that same courtesy.&nbsp;

**3\. Paint the new space.** Nothing makes a home feel fresher than adding a bright coat of paint, and what better time is there to get the job done than when the home is already empty?&nbsp;

**4\. Hire a handyman.** You most likely hired an inspector while you were under contract, and there were probably a few items the seller wouldn’t agree to tackle on their own, or would only agree to offer a credit for. Once the time comes for you to move in, don’t delay in getting these problems addressed by a professional.&nbsp;

**5\. Child-proof (or pet-proof) the home.** If you’ve got children, grandchildren, or pets, your home should be a safe environment for them. Always make the necessary adjustments, like adding cabinet locks and covering sharp edges, as soon as you move in.&nbsp;

**6\. Hire someone to spray for bugs.** No one likes a pest-infested home, and preventing a bug problem is much easier than getting rid of one.&nbsp;
