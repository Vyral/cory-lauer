Keller Williams is proud to unveil their new mortgage company, simply called **Keller Mortgage.** Keller Mortgage can do loans in every state except New York, Utah, and Hawaii, but their products are exclusive to KW agents and their clients. Both our buyers and sellers can reap the benefits of Keller Mortgage, **and here’s what those benefits are.**

Buyers can save thousands with a ZeroPlus loan, **which has no fees and provides $1,000 at closing to go toward any home buying costs.** There a few requirements: You need a minimum credit score of 600 and the loan amount must be $150,000 or higher.

Sellers, let’s say you get an offer from a buyer who wants you to cover some of their closing costs. Regardless of whether they’re using a KW agent or not, **we can invite that buyer to use our program.** On a $250,000 loan, they’ll save $5,000 and also get the additional $1,000 credit. On a $500,000 loan, they’ll save $7,500 and still get the extra $1,000. These incentives mean you can stay firm on your sale price.

Keller Mortgage can also be used for refinancing your loan. **How can this program offer so many great incentives to its users?** It streamlines the process online—there’s not a lot of overhead cost and there’s no advertising or marketing. **They pass along the savings to you.**
